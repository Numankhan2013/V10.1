# STATE.md — Current Project State and Handoff

> Concise operational handoff. History belongs in `SESSION_LOG.md`; durable
> reasoning in `DECISIONS.md`; future work in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Repo / release state

- Repo: `Numankhan2013/V10.1`.
- Resolve live branch/HEAD from Git; do not hardcode self-staling HEAD values.
- Current verified explanation lineage reaches
  `feature/marrow-explanation-rollout-physio-ch05-current` / PR #24.
- Exact verified Chapter 5 candidate: `f170eb8517998cdaf4229240d2c2a273c6d98cf8`.
- Engineering Gate 259 and full Android/PWA run 539 both passed.
- Latest immutable verified preview: `https://3cce6bfb.nk-qbank.pages.dev`.
- Production promotion remains explicit and guarded; run 539 skipped production.
- Accepted baseline / rollback baseline remains **V11.6 Content Quality** at `125d68b`
  until the user explicitly promotes a later product baseline.
- Accepted product commit: `125d68b`.

## Current Marrow bank

Shared architecture:
`MARROW_RECORDS` → `MARROW_BY_SUBJECT` → `BANKS_BY_SUBJECT`.
There is one shared Practice/CBT/Review/FSRS/sync/module/analytics/navigation engine.

Supplied Marrow ED8 scope:
- Anatomy: **819 questions / 48 topics**.
- Biochemistry: **543 / 26**.
- Physiology: **753 / 33**.
- Total: **2,115 globally unique questions / 107 topics**.

Raw imported Marrow source is authoritative and immutable. Source bundles remain
manifest/hash validated and ingestion fails closed on corruption/count/ID/option/
topic-link drift.

## Explanation-quality phase

Canonical procedure: `docs/MARROW_EXPLANATION_FINE_TUNING.md` +
`docs/MARROW_BANK_INTEGRATION.md`.

Approved learner-facing contract:
- one meaningful Key Takeaway;
- source-faithful structured detailed explanation;
- 1–4 selective emphasis anchors that exist verbatim in display text;
- exactly three concise wrong-option rationales mapped to the three incorrect
  source options for four-option SBA;
- ID-keyed augmentation separate from raw source;
- source tables/figures/provenance remain source-owned and separate;
- incomplete/garbled source content should be reconstructed when high-confidence recovery is possible from source evidence and/or standard medical literature; every reconstruction remains provenance-marked and auditable;
- FSRS/session behavior is untouched.

Current deterministic inventory:
- **429 enhanced / 1,686 pending**.
- Anatomy approved reference: **62**.
- Physiology approved pilot: **80** across Chapters 1–4.
- Biochemistry enhanced: **259**; Chapters 1–11 are complete on the current
  stacked explanation lineage, including fixed gold-sample overlaps.
- Physiology Chapter 5 **Body Fluids: 28/28 complete**.
- Physiology enhanced total is now **108**.
- Physiology Chapter 5 inventory fingerprint:
  `09989df1e8745f7338abf146fb4eb1337738ecaf4dafb1b69f9c76314e521ea8`.

Physiology rollout infrastructure was generalized on PR #24:
- `data/marrow/explanation_physio_ch*_v1.json` discovery in inventory;
- shared app loader merges Physiology chapter augmentations with the existing
  80-question Physiology pilot;
- `tools/test_marrow_physio_explanation_rollout.py` provides fail-closed
  source-ID/chapter/emphasis/distractor validation;
- both Engineering Gate and full Android/PWA workflow run the Physiology validator;
- Biochemistry rollout validation was generalized so other subjects may add
  enhanced records without invalidating its subject-local guarantees.

Representative Chapter 5 browser regression:
Physiology → Marrow → Body Fluids → Q17 verifies the permeant-urea / tonicity
explanation and exactly three distractor rationales through the real learner UI.

## Image pipeline / ownership

- Explanation refinement and image integration remain separate workstreams.
- The primary agent is taking ownership of **image integration**.
- Preserve source-native figure/image metadata and source fidelity.
- Do not reconstruct medically meaningful figures from prose when source assets
  exist or when the source is ambiguous.
- Historical image Batch 01 was build-verified; Batch 02 had six
  REVIEW_REQUIRED candidates checkpointed separately. Reconcile live Git state
  before resuming that pipeline.

## Known problems / cautions

- Build-verified ≠ device-verified ≠ accepted production baseline.
- User has independently checked the current preview; do not spend agent usage
  repeating routine visual verification unless needed for a code-quality issue.
- Do not rewrite raw Marrow JSON/JSONL/shards for learner-facing cleanup.
- Do not fork Practice/CBT/Review/FSRS/sync/modules/navigation by subject.
- Do not alter Topics taxonomy during explanation or image work.
- Keep production promotion deliberate.

## Next step / ownership split

- **Primary agent:** inspect current GitHub state/code quality and continue the
  Marrow source-image integration pipeline.
- **Explanation refinement agent:** when resumed, continue from
  **Physiology Chapter 6 — Physiology of Nerve**, source order, without touching
  the image-integration ownership.
